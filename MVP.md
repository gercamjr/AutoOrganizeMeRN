# Auto Organize Me - MVP Document

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:** Auto Organize Me is a mobile application designed to help auto mechanics efficiently manage their daily workflow, customer interactions, and administrative tasks. The app aims to streamline operations by providing tools for customer management, task tracking, invoicing, scheduling, and photo documentation, all accessible offline with local data storage.

**Target Audience:** Independent auto mechanics and small auto repair shops.

## 2. Goals

- Provide a centralized platform for managing core aspects of an auto mechanic's work.
- Improve organization and efficiency in handling customer information and vehicle details.
- Simplify task management and tracking of job statuses.
- Streamline the invoicing process and enable payment tracking.
- Offer a clear scheduling system for job assignments.
- Enable easy photo capture and association with vehicles and tasks for documentation.
- Ensure all data is stored locally on the device, allowing for full offline functionality.

## 3. Core Features (MVP Scope)

### 3.1. Customer Management

- **Functionality:**
  - Add, edit, and view customer profiles.
  - Store customer details:
    - Name
    - Contact Information (phone, email, address)
  - Store vehicle details associated with a customer:
    - Make
    - Model
    - Year
    - VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)
    - Engine Type
- **Data Storage:** Local device storage.

### 3.2. Task Management

- **Functionality:**
  - Create, edit, and view tasks.
  - Categorize tasks (e.g., Repairs, Maintenance, Diagnostics).
  - Assign statuses to tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Awaiting Parts, Completed, Cancelled).
  - Associate tasks with specific customers and their vehicles.
- **Data Storage:** Local device storage.

### 3.3. Invoice Management

- **Functionality:**
  - Generate invoices based on completed tasks.
  - Include the following on invoices:
    - Customer and Vehicle Information
    - List of tasks performed (linked from Task Management)
    - Breakdown of costs:
      - Parts (with individual item costs)
      - Labor costs
    - Total amount due
  - Track payment status for invoices (e.g., Unpaid, Partially Paid, Paid).
- **Data Storage:** Local device storage.

### 3.4. Scheduling

- **Functionality:**
  - A calendar view for scheduling jobs.
  - Assign tasks/jobs to specific time slots.
  - View scheduled jobs by day, week, or month.
- **Data Storage:** Local device storage.

### 3.5. Photo Capture and Storage

- **Functionality:**
  - Capture photos using the device camera.
  - Associate photos with:
    - Specific vehicles (e.g., pre-repair condition, specific parts).
    - Specific tasks (e.g., completed repair work, diagnostic findings).
  - View stored photos related to a vehicle or task.
- **Data Storage:** Local device storage (photos stored within the app's sandboxed storage).

## 4. Technical Stack

- **Framework:** React Native with Expo
- **Data Storage:** Local device storage (e.g., SQLite, AsyncStorage, or a similar local database solution compatible with React Native/Expo).

## 5. Design and User Experience (UX)

- **Theme:** Dark theme.
- **Style:** Modern and "techy" aesthetic.
- **Animations:** Polished and professional animations to enhance user experience.
- **Offline First:** The application must be fully functional without an internet connection. All data operations will occur locally.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Offline Capability:** The app must work seamlessly when the mobile device is offline.
- **Local Data Storage:** All application data (customer info, tasks, invoices, schedules, photos) must be stored securely on the user's mobile device.
- **Performance:** The app should be responsive and performant, even with a growing amount of local data.
- **Usability:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface, requiring minimal training for mechanics.

## 7. Future Considerations (Out of MVP Scope)

- Cloud synchronization and backup.
- Multi-user support.
- Reporting and analytics.
- Parts inventory management.
- Integration with accounting software.
- Push notifications for reminders.

## 8. Success Metrics (Post-MVP)

- User adoption rate.
- Frequency of app usage.
- Time saved by mechanics on administrative tasks.
- User feedback and satisfaction ratings.
